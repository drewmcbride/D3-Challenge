# D3-Challenge

For this project I analyzed state populations to determine a relationship between metrics such as poverty, age, household income, obesity, smoking rate, and the lack of healthcare.

There is a positive correlation present between the poverty rate and obesity in states, with Mississippi having the highest poverty rate and nearly the highest obesity rate.

Additionally, there is a negative correlation between household income and the percentage of smokers in states, with West Virginia having the highest rate of smokers and 3rd lowest median household income.
